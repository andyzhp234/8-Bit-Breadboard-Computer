# LCD Display Controller using Arduino Nano

This Arduino Nano based controller that enables an LCD display to receive 8-bit input from a bus and output the corresponding English letter based on the ASCII value of the 8-bit inputs.

# Pin Configuration:

### LCD Display Pin Assignments
To properly interface with the LCD display, we will assign the following pins on the Arduino:

* LCD RS pin is connected to Arduino's digital pin 5.
* LCD Enable pin is connected to Arduino's digital pin 6.
* LCD D4 pin is connected to Arduino's digital pin 7.
* LCD D5 pin is connected to Arduino's digital pin 8.
* LCD D6 pin is connected to Arduino's digital pin 9.
* LCD D7 pin is connected to Arduino's digital pin 10.
