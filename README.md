# README for 8-bit Computer

This repository contains all the design files, instructions, and code related to my 8-bit Breadboard Computer. This computer was built entirely on a breadboard, following the instructional series by Ben Eater.

## Project Overview
This project is a simple 8-bit computer assembled entirely on a breadboard. The computer is capable of running basic programs and demonstrates fundamental concepts of computer architecture such as memory management, instruction decoding, and the fetch-decode-execute cycle.

The design is based on the von Neumann architecture, featuring separate instruction and data memory.

## Components
The computer is comprised of the following modules:

* **Clock Module**: Generates clock pulses to synchronize the operation of the computer.
* **CPU Module**: Executes instructions stored in memory. Includes an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for performing operations.
* **Memory Module**: Stores instructions and data.
* **Input/Output Module**: Allows for interaction with the computer via switches and LED indicators.


## Device specifications:
* Maximum Clock Speed: 303Hz
* Memory: 16 Bytes
* Turing Complete

I would like to extend my gratitude to Ben Eater for his clear, detailed tutorials that guided this project. This project would not have been possible without his instructional series.
